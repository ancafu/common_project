            <h2>Carter</h2> 
            <img src="images/carter.jpeg" alt = "Carter is a husky with black, gray, and white fur. One of his eyes is blue, while the other one is brown. His nose is black but red in the middle. His fur is very fluffy and thick." style="width:400px">
            <p>Carter was born in Seattle. However, my brother bought him and brought him to Boston. Whenever my brother did not have time to walk Carter, he would put him on the treadmill. When Carter became too much of a responsibility for my brother as a college student, he took Carter to Vancouver to live with my mom, sister, and me. Because we lived in the mountains, he would sometimes howl in the middle of the night whenever he saw a wild animal.”</p>
            <p>Whenever I threw him a ball, he ran to the ball but never brought it back to me. He would sometimes escape the backyard of our house if we forgot to close the gates by accident. Even if we looked for him everywhere and did not find him, he knew the way home and always came back in the end. He loved going to the forest and the beach. He had his own spot on the living room couch and would television with us if he was bored or tired.</p>

            <img src="images/bear.JPG" alt="A fluffy black, white, and tan Shiba Inu with pointed ears named Bear." style="width:400px">
            <p>Bear is a lazy, food-loving dog that is sometimes playful. His favorite activity is lying in the sun on his side and lounging. He enjoys playing with his toys and loves to fetch them when you throw them, but eventually, he gets bored and just stops fetching them and lays down.</p>
            <p>Bear is also scared of a lot of things. He doesn't like water (showers and even rain) or getting his nails clipped, and he's sometimes even so lazy that he'll just stop walking and sit down until you turn around and go back home.</p>

            <h2>Milktea</h2> 
            <img src="images/Main.JPG" alt="Milktea taking nap" style="width:400px">
            <p>Milktea is a Scottish fold with a personality of a princess. She loves her veggies and refuses to eat anything dropped on the ground. She makes it clear when she has a demand of any sort by complaining in a loud, distinguished manner. If what she says could be translated, it probably would be, “This is atrocious, the water container has been empty for the 3rd time this week. I want to see the manager.”</p>
            <p>Despite her cuteness and royalty, she actually suffers from a genetic disorder intentionally brought upon by humans. I highly advise against keeping a Scottish fold because they are in constant pain when they reach around 2 years old. Cartilage accumulates around her paw joints and tail joints and it becomes painful for them to even walk. She is living evidence of human's cruelty of breeding animals to look pretty while sacrificing the animals' health.</p>

            <h2>Finn</h2> 
            <img src="images/Finn_Halloween.jpg" alt="Finn wears a bat costume for halloween" style="width:400px">
            <p>Finn is a 7 year old grey cat. I feel like no one really knows cat breeds so I'm just gonna go with grey. He loves doing tricks for treats and his favorite is giving high fives to people. He might as well be a dog as he loves the outdoors and meeting new people. I can only describe him as goofy and chaotic.”</p>
            <p>Finn's biggest enemy is his vet. I don't know whether or not it's because his vet is an MSU alum, but he doesn't like him. He actually has to be prescribed a sedative before he goes to the vet office because he'll suddenly act like he was never a house cat for 7 years.</p>

            <p>Lucy is a 17-year-old calico that I've had since I was 5, she has pretty much grown up with me my whole life. Even though she's old she's still kickin' it and enjoys running around the house at 4am.”</p>
            <p>Her favorite foods include anything but her kibble. She enjoys sunbathing and long naps, along with lots of petting. However, she hates getting her stomach rubbed.</p>
